This is a starter point for creating slide decks using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) themed to feel a bit more like [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big).

The goals here are:

- slides that are easy to write (via Markdown)
- slide decks that are easy to host (via Github Pages)

## Editing slides

Edit `slides.md`.

## Deployment

Being that this repo uses a branch named `gh-pages`, GitHub will automatically deploy itself as `https://{your-username}.github.io/{your-branch-name}`.
